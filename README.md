# Lunar-Meteoroid-Environment
This code is the result of a work done for and at the Lunar and Planetary Institute (USRA/NASA) in an effort to contribute to the Artemis III mission 

The data in the code are from an extended literature review and gather together all the results in order to give a broader idea of the lunar natural meteoroid environment. A study has been carried out in order to characterize both the meteoroid's (asteroids and comets) direct impact on the lunar surface (first flux) but also the created ejecta (secondary flux) that sometimes can reach the other side of the Moon due to the energy involved. 

Frequency distribution in units of km^-2*h^-1 is used in order to give a general overview of the results. 

The secondary ejecta behavior is modeled using cratering dynamics and well-known power laws scaling from Housen and Holsapple mainly.
Ballistic equations that take into account the sphericity of the Moon are leveraged to compute the range and max altitude of the ejecta. 

The target material is the lunar regolith. If studying basaltic surfaces, please update the physical properties accordingly. 

If you have any questions/remarks, please reach out, I would be happy to answer you!
